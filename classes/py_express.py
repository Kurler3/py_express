# Core Concepts:

# HTTP routing (with support for dynamic paths).
# Handling HTTP methods and paths.
# Middlewares for pre- and post-processing.
# Error handling and returning meaningful status codes and responses.

# Main components youâ€™ll need:

# An HTTP request handling system (request and response abstractions).
# A routing system that maps URLs (with HTTP methods) to functions.
# Middleware support (global and route-specific).
# Static file support.
# Server loop to listen on a port and handle requests.
